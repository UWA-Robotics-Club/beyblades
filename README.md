# Build Your Own Beyblade

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Build Your Own Beyblade" project by the UWA Robotics Club! This project was created for UWA O-Day as our approach to meaningful, interactive "merch" - something fun, easy to understand, and genuinely desirable rather than branded rubbish that ends up forgotten or discarded.

The project also served as a creative sustainability solution, allowing us to repurpose "nearly finished" 3D printing filament spools. For O-Day 2025, we used leftover plastic donated by 3D printing enthusiasts from all around Perth, giving new life to materials that would otherwise go unused.

These 3D-printable Beyblades are designed to be accessible, engaging, and affordable to produce. While attendees received pre-made Beyblades at our O-Day booth, this repository contains all the files needed to create your own complete Beyblade system at home, including the launchers that weren't distributed at the event.

## What's a Beyblade?

A Beyblade is a spinning top toy that can battle against other Beyblades in an arena. Our design features customizable teetch that allow you to create a Beyblade with your choice of teeth and colours. 

## Components

A complete Beyblade system consists of:

### Beyblade Parts
1. **Top Plate** - The upper disc of the Beyblade
2. **Bottom Plate** - The base of the Beyblade with a central pivot
3. **Core** - The central connection piece that holds everything together
4. **Teeth** - Attack features that are sandwiched between the top and bottom plates
   
### Launcher System
1. **Launcher Body** - Holds the Beyblade before launch
2. **Ripcord** - Pulls through the launcher to spin and release the Beyblade

## Build Instructions

### Step 1: Pick Your Style
Select your preferred design for the top plate, bottom plate, teeth, and color scheme. Different combinations will affect the Beyblade's performance, weight distribution, and attack capabilities.

### Step 2: Put Blades into Teeth
Insert your chosen attack blades into the teeth components. These will determine how your Beyblade interacts with opponents.

### Step 3: Place Top Plate On
Position the top plate over the assembled teeth, aligning with the mounting points.

### Step 4: Screw the Core In
Insert the core through the center and secure all components together with the provided screw. Make sure everything is firmly attached but can still spin freely.

### Step 5: Battle!
Place your Beyblade in the launcher, insert the ripcord, and pull quickly to release your Beyblade into the arena!

### Printing 
- The Teeth are designed to be printed vertically, this is conventionally a bad idea as it results in weak parts and fails regularly. However the goal is for the teeth to be weak, so that they break during the battle, making more of a specticle. 

### Parts List
- All STL files for the Beyblade components are included in the `/STL` folder
- All STEP files for the Beyblade components are included in the `/STEP` folder
